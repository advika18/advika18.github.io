	The above is an hour long talk on using Machine Learning in monitoring biodiversity. The talk focuses on the current methods in practice and research particularly in the computer vision domain. Some of the important data sources and projects mentioned from the talk are below:

* https://earthengine.google.com/: Contains satellite data for remote sensing of forestry/ oceans
* https://www.globalforestwatch.org/ : Project based on earth engine to monitor deforestation
* https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/: Project based on earth engine to monitor global fishing
* https://aries.integratedmodelling.org/technology/  | https://seea.un.org/content/aries-for-seea : A model for understanding ecology of a given region. 
* https://www.gbif.org/ : Biodiversity monitoring data source
* https://www.wildlifeinsights.org/:  Live Camera trap data
* https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/: App to classify bird sounds
* https://lila.science/datasets/snapshot-serengeti : Camera trap data
